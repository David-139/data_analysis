    "Logistic regression is part of a linear models. It is mainly used on binary classification problems, but can be extended into more complex ones. Main concept behind this model, as name suggest, is logistic function which helps us understand the relationship of one binary (0-1) variable and one or many more other variables. In its core, the logit function transform our variable into 0-1 scale, using base of natural log by this equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "__$$\\frac{1} { 1 - e^{- value}}$$__\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation ensures the range between 0 - 1. But instead of using the least square method (which cant be used here), the model predicts the propability and finds the best fitted sigmoid (S shaped function) so that the curve with maximum likelihood is selected base upon data we are feeding the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get deeper on the math and logic behind it, there are many relevant sources to learn them from, much better than I would be able to attempt to create here, so I suggest to do so. So lets try to implement this in Sklearn\n",
