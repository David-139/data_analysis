    "As propably one of the most time consuming (for programmer) and tedious task of data analysis and modeling, preprocessing is an essential part, which when done correctly, makes further work faster, cleaner and all around better, be it the analysis, modeling or any other task you may need. On the other hand, when done poorly, will sabotage any additional work, will slow your progress, distort the outcomes and eventually set you back to point zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "So make sure you get to know all preprocessing skills. for example When someone asks you to filter specific information, do some fast statistics, count missing data etc., you know exactly what to do. Of course you won´t remember everything, but it is important that you know where to look and get the right documentation for the job needed. With that said, I will try to demonstrate as much as I can, but it is your job to be creative, to come up with ideas, questions and problems that you would like to know the answer to, and than try to extract it from the data. You can read all the books in the world, but nothing ever beats actualy getting your hands dirty, so lets dig in \n",
