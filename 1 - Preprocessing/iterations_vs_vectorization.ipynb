Working with dataframe with few thousand rows wont make much of a difference, but the moment we start working with Big Data, the chosen method could save us some serious time! I myself must admit, i did not pay much time to this topic up until now, but __learn the best practices / best ways of coding as you start, so you will make them your habit__. There are many great sources for this topic, so i will just simplify them and try them out in this notebook, but definitely read through some stackoverflow and documentations on this, its the core of many more operations you will use "

    "<font color=#ac9f00>Looping</font> is commonly known and used in most standard programming languages and as such is then used here (as i did...). This consists of your standard vanilla for loops or iteration methods in Pandas __.itertuples(), .iterrows()__. These functions run through all rows separately, thus generating each individual row as object for processing. And that is a lot of extra work done without any purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=#ac9f00>Vectorization</font> on the other hand is optimized for speed. The difference is in a way the data is accessed, we can think of DataFrame as a number of series next to each other (columns) and use vectorized functions - in both numpy and pandas you will find most of your needed functions. These functions are then applied on the individual Series - array of the data we need to manipulate. So there is no need to access each individual value for each iteration step, we work in one, simple and effective array"
